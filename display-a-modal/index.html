		<p>This page demonstrates how to progressively enhance going from 
		an index page to a detail page. Specifically, instead of leading
		the user to another page, clicking the image link below will open
		a modal with the enlargement inside. Clicking outside the enlargement 
		or on the X closes the enlargement.</p>

					When the user clicks on the thumbnail<br>
					Then the photograph is enlarged in a modal
				</li>
