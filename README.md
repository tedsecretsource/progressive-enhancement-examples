# Progressive Enhancement Examples

This repo contains a series of examples of 
[progressive enhancment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement). The 
reason behind this repo is multiple people I've met recently, including
some of our developers, struggle to understand what PE is. Graceful
degredation makes sense to them but not PE.

The examples you'll find here include:

- Display a modal
- Display the main menu at the top of the screen instead of the bottom
- Using JavaScript to reduce network size when submitting a form
- Add a Print Page button to a receipt or reservation confirmation
- Using JS to provide an image preview prior to uploading

## Display a Modal



## Main Menu at Top of Page

## Ajaxify a Form

## Add a Print Page Button

This example comes from this description of [Progressive Enhancement vs.
Graceful Degredation](https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/Graceful_degredation_versus_progressive_enhancement)
